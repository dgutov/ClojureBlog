# Blog description

The blog is written in the Rails-like style. It utilizes the following principles:
1) MVC architecture;
2) RESTful design;
3) Convention over configuration;
4) DRY (Don't repeat yourself);
5) Instant gratification.

## Architecture overview

The directory structure is the following:
blog/templates -- root directory for views. It contains subdirectories for each
		  entity (post, comment, user) and the common application templates
		  located in the dirrectory app.
blog/src/blog/system -- contains the common functionality (utils.clj), database
		  connectivity options (db.clj), and the router (routes.clj).
blog/src/blog/controllers -- directory for controllers.
blog/src/blog/model -- directory for models.

Controller here contains all the business logic. It accepts the user input,
interacts with the database and renders a response (or redirects to another page).

Model is just a means of interacting with the database. It contains functions for
convenient fetching of entities, creating/updating/deleting them.

Views are implemented using the clj-soy library which is a wrapper over the
Google Closure Templates. More documentation and usage examples are here:
http://code.google.com/closure/templates .

## Application description

The code contains many comments that's why there is not so much description here.
Just follow this advice:

1) Do not dig deeply into system/utils.clj. It is a bit complicated and should be
used "as-is". For those who are interested in it -- it has good comments and usage examples.

2) Define routes for your RESTful action using the "route" macro:
E.g. (route GET "/post/show/:id" post/show)
It has the following syntax: (route <GET/POST> <page_address> <controller_function>).
Define all the URL-parameters as keywords (:id -- is the parameter here).

3) Define the controller actions using the "defaction" macro. It automates destructuring
of the parameters. For example:
(defaction show [id]
	. . .)
In this case there are three local variables available inside the created function show:
 * session -- hash-map which holds the session;
 * params -- hash-map which holds all the user parameters (URL parameters and POST-ed html-form parameters);
 * id -- destructured id parameter.
You don't need to destructure the parameters manually. The "defaction" macro will process all the parameters
in the vector and destructure them automatically.

4) Use the "render-action" macro to render a RESTful action. It has the following format:
(render-action <entity>#<action> <parameters>)
For example:
(render-action post#show
	 {:post (post/fetch id)
	  :comment_list (comment/fetch-list id)}))
It will automatically locate the template "templates/post/show.soy", decorate it with the
application template "templates/app/post.soy" and provide the parameters there.

## Usage
1) Create mysql database. The scripts are located in blog/sql/db.sql.
2) Download an install the mysql-connector-java (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)
 as a maven artifact. Just run the "lein deps" command,
it will fail and tell you what to do to install the mysql-connector-java.
3) Run the application:
$ lein deps
$ lein ring server
